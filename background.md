# 📜 Farcaster Background: From 2020 Spark to 2025 Wallet Boom

Farcaster isn't an app—it's a *protocol* (think Ethereum for social feeds). Founders Dan Romero (@dwr) & Varun Srinivasan launched it to fix Web2's mess: Data theft, bans, algo prisons. Result? Onchain ownership + viral Frames (posts that *do* stuff, like mint NFTs).

## Epic Timeline (Beginner-Friendly)
| Year | Big Move | Hype Moment | Beginner Tip |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **2020** | Beta launch: Decentralized "Twitter" on Ethereum. Hubs (decentralized servers) store data forever. | Early cypherpunk vibes—freedom from Big Tech. | Start here: Read the whitepaper (5 mins) for "why own your graph?" |
| **2023** | Warpcast app drops: Easy wallet sign-up, "casts" like tweets. Hits 100k users. | Made Web3 social *fun*—no more clunky UIs. | Download Warpcast: Free, 2-min setup. Your first cast? "Hello, Farcaster!" |
| **2024** | Frames explode: Posts embed apps (polls, tips). DAUs surge 1,722% to 50k+. BNB/Solana support added. | Turned scrolling into *building*—Web3's killer app. | Try a Frame: Post a poll on Base dApps. Feels like magic! |
| **2025** | Snapchain mainnet (Apr 16): 10k+ TPS hybrid chain. Wallet pivot (Dec 8): Social → seamless trading/onchain life. $1B val, 1M+ users. | Jesse: "Flywheel for Base—earn from what you love." DAUs dipped 40%, but wallet focus flips it. | Bridge $10 ETH to Base via app—your Farcaster feed powers it. |

**Fun Fact**: Farcaster's "protocol paradox" (tech wins, users chase)? 2025's wallet shift crushes it—integrated with Base App for gasless casts. Ties to $BASE hype: Active users = retro drop magnets.
